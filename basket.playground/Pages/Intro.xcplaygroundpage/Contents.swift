 ## Shopping Baskets

 Picture yourself working for an online grocery company. One of your first tasks is to model shopping for groceries into data structures. Lets do that in this playground. There are a few pages in this playground that you can navigate via the [Next](@next) and [Previous](@previous) links.
 
 We will write code to complete the implementation of a basket of items that outputs its total cost.
  The basket can contain one or more of the following items:
  - Bananas
  - Bags of Lemons

 If you are new to Swift, then it might be fun to make some more items for the store. We are happy to accept pull requests for more items.
 
 In order to support the TDD style of development, we provide a few tests. Some tests are broken and it is your job to get them passing. Note that broken tests in a playground look like compile errors.
